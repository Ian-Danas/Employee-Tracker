## Description <a id = "Description"></a>
This project servers as a command line application to track a workplace. The project allows users to create departments, roles within departments, and employees to belong to those roles. This application allows the user to also view all this data that is stored in a database to see what employees they have which role they are connected and so on.
## Installation <a id = "Installation"></a>
If running from the command line the user will first need to clone the the repository code onto their own machine. From there they will need to install all the dependencies included in the package.json file by running the "npm -i" in the commands line. They will also need to run the schema.sql file located in the db folder to setup the database tables. There is also a seeds file in the db folder to seed the tables with starting data is choosen. From there they can run the index.js file in the terminal to run the program by calling the command "node index.js".
## Usage <a id = "Usage"></a>
To use the application the user can select one of the choices presented. Once a choice has been made if the choice is to just view one of the tables then the table will be printed to the console. If the choice was to add a employee,role, or department some new questions will be asked. The user can enter the information with what they like and once done the information will be added to the database and can be viewed by selecting to view the tables again. The program will bring the user back to the main set of questions once they are done with the action. Once the user is done using the program they can select quit which will end the program.
